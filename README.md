## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the folder**:

   ```bash

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Task data is stored in the browser's **localStorage**
* When you **add** a task, it’s saved and displayed instantly
* Clicking the **edit icon** allows updating a task's details
* Clicking the **trash icon** deletes a task from the list
* All updates reflect immediately without page reload

## 🔒 Note

This project uses `localStorage`, so the data is browser-specific and not shared across devices. No backend or database is used.
